# Kntnt CSS Framework

*Kntnt CSS Framework* (*KCF*) is a comprehensive set of cascading stylesheets that makes it easier to build web sites.

## Background

There are many CSS frameworks out there. The arguably most known is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) – an amazing toolkit “featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.” Two other full-featured CSS frameworks are [Foundation](https://get.foundation) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/). Two leaner frameworks worth mentioning are [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/). They are all great.

But they all focus on grids, buttons and forms – the stuff needed to build an excellent user interface. That’s not what we need at Kntnt.

## Content – not grids

KCF is developed by [Kntnt](https://www.kntnt.se) – a Swedish sales, marketing and web technology agency. We help companies and organizations to strengthen their brand, drive demand and generate inbound leads with content marketing on the web. We build online magazines for our clients. That’s a central piece in the larger puzzle of attracting potential clients, winning their trust, and converting them to customers.

Therefore, we need re-usable and customizable CSS that allow us to build content-rich web sites that will enable our clients, people who are not designers or developers, to present their content in a flexible way.
